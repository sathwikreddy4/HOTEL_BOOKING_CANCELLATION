# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis üè®üìä

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to understand customer behavior, booking trends, and cancellation patterns. Using data from over 119,000 records, we explored how different factors‚Äîsuch as hotel type, booking month, and guest demographics‚Äîaffect the likelihood of a cancellation. An interactive Excel dashboard was created to visualize key findings.

## Objectives

* Identify patterns and causes behind hotel booking cancellations.
* Compare guest behaviors between **City Hotels** and **Resort Hotels**.
* Enable data-driven decisions through visualization and metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset includes 119,390 hotel booking records with attributes such as:

* Booking dates and durations
* Guest types and demographics
* Hotel type (City vs Resort)
* Booking status (Canceled/Not Canceled)
* Arrival date, market segment, and more

## Key Insights

* **Total Bookings:** 119,390
* **Total Cancellations:** 44,224 (\~37%)
* City hotels had a significantly higher cancellation rate than resort hotels.
* Highest bookings occurred in **summer months**, while cancellations peaked in **early months**.
* Couples and families showed the highest booking frequency.

## Tools Used

* **Excel**: For dashboard creation and data visualization
* **Pandas & NumPy** *(optional if code involved)*: For data preprocessing and analysis
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** *(optional if code involved)*: For graphical exploration

## Dashboard Preview

Includes visualizations for:

* Monthly booking and cancellation trends
* Guest type distributions
* Hotel-wise cancellations
* Year-wise arrival trends

## Outcomes

This project offers valuable insights into how hotels can better manage bookings, reduce cancellation rates, and optimize room availability based on guest trends.
